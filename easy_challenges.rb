=begin sum of multiples

Write a program that, given a natural number and a set of one or more other numbers, can find the sum of all the multiples of the numbers in the set that are less than the first number. If the set of numbers is not given, use a default set of 3 and 5.

For instance, if we list all the natural numbers up to, but not including, 20 that are multiples of either 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18. The sum of these multiples is 78.

-------------- P 
input: integer and set of numbers, if no sets provided, default to 3 and 5
output: integer - the sum of the multiples

   rules:
  - find the sum of all the unique values of the multiples
  - multiples should be up to but not including the target number
-------------- D
- range of integers
- array
-------------- A 

- create a class called SumOfMultiples
- create a constructor method which should accept a number of integers - but if no values are given, default the values to 3 and 5
  - initialize an instance variable and have it point to the number of given integers 
- create a class method called `to` which should accept one integer
  - create a instance 
  - call to `to` method and pass in the target integer
- create an instance method called `to` which should accept one integer
  - iterate through a range starting from 1 up to but not including the target number
    - iterate through the array of divisors
      - retrieve the integers which are evenly divisible by the current divisor
  - find the unique values and then find the sum of the array
